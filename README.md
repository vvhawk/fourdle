**fordle** is an android app that puts a spin on the [popular](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/03/technology/wordle-word-game-creator.html) game [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). 

I made this project for [CodePath's](https://www.codepath.org/) [Android Development Pathway](https://www.codepath.org/courses/android-development)

This app is still a work in progress. A preview is given below. Look forward to a video demo soon. My final goal is to publish it on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/games?hl=en_US&gl=US). Will update this README as progress is made. 

The following functionality is completed:

- [x] **User has 3 chances to guess a random 4 letter word**
- [x] **After 3 guesses, user should no longer be able to submit another guess**
- [x] **After each guess, user sees the "correctness" of the guess**
- [x] **After all guesses are taken, user can see the target word displayed**
* [x] Dynamic UI
* [x] Dark mode support
* [x] App icon
* [x] Splash screen
* [x] Advanced correctness indicator
* [x] Different music for different situations (win, loss, 3 lives, 2 lives, 1 life) -> TOTAL of 5 songs
* [x] Ability to turn on and off music  
* [x] Help screen
